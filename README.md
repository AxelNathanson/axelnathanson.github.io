## Master thesis
I am currently writing my Master thesis for [Saab](https://www.saab.com/) on utilizing Deep Reinforcement Learning to optimise the management of radar resources while performing surveillance and tracking. The project includes the simulation and tracking of the targets as well as implementation of DRL - architectures. 

I am writing my thesis alone but with the guidance of my supervisor [Adam Andersson](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/personal/Sidor/adam-andersson.aspx), whose current research topic concerns the use of deep learning to obtain accelerated and scalable algorithms for computationally challenging problems. 

## Project examples
The reason I created this page was to be able to showcase the projects I have carried out. Both as part of my studies but also outside of school.

## Experience

### IRLAB Therapeutics AB, 
**Project, Nov 2020 - Jan 2021**

I was part of a group of students who worked with IRLAB and Smartr to model an unknown filtering algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in an old analyser-unit used to record the trajectories of rats during experimental trials. As part of the study, both known filtering algorithms like Kalman-filters and Splining-algorithms were evaluated as well as new ones created. As a result of the study, we could rule out several classic filtering algorithms while achieving the best results with the algorithms designed during the study. My main responsibility was the statistical analysis of the trajectories, providing the basis for the algorithm design.

### CEVT(China Euro Vehicle Technology)
**Student Intern, Jun 2018 - Sep 2019**

During my time with the Vehicle Homologation and Compliance team, I was responsible for the migration of all legal requirements into two new databases. One database for the internal review of the legal requirements, and one used to communicate them during projects. I also assisted in the mapping of new legal areas.


## Education

### Chalmers University of Technology, MSc in Mathematics
**Program: Engineering mathematics and computational science, 2019-2021**

My master programme extended my knowledge of mathematics and statistics while giving me the computational tools to use them. I have focused my studies within the fields of algorithms, statistics and machine learning. 

### Technische Universität München, Exchange
**Faculty of Mathematics, 2019-2020**

I was very fortunate to be able to visit the TUM right before Corona hit. During my stay, I took courses in German, statistics and Machine Learning. The courses that influenced me the most were "Deep Learning", with Prof. Niessner and "Machine Learning for Sequential Data and Graphs" given by Prof. Günnemann.

### Chalmers University of Technology, BSc in Physics
**Program: Engineering Physics, 2016-2019**

My undergraduate physics programme covered a broad range of subjects in physics, mathematics and engineering. The very diverse syllabus covers courses like quantum physics, complex analysis as well as algorithms and statistics.  

For my bachelor thesis, I worked with the department of physics on [Simulating Many-Particle Systems on an Emulated Quantum Computer](https://odr.chalmers.se/handle/20.500.12380/300640) (in Swedish). I was responsible for a lot of the implementations on the emulated quantum computer, as well as the optimization performed in the study.

### Uppsala University
**Law School, 2014-2015**

I studied for three semesters at one of the top law school in Sweden. During my studies, I realised that I was more interested in mathematics and physics, but did take courses in:
* Basic legal methods, state law and constitutional EU-law.
* Civil Law: contract, labour, intellectual property and family law.
